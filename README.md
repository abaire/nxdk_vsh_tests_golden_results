Output of abaire/nxdk_vsh_tests on XBOX 1.0 hardware.

[Browsable in the wiki](https://github.com/abaire/nxdk_vsh_tests_golden_results/wiki/Results)

*Note*: web-display of output may not always match the visible output from hardware.
In particular, the framebuffer captures in this repository will respect alpha values in a
way that may not match the XBOX behavior (which typically ignores the alpha component in the
final composition that is sent to the video encoder).
